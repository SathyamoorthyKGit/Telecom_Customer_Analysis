# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on customer behavior and key metrics in the telecom domain. The project includes visualizations and insights derived from customer data, aimed at understanding patterns such as churn rates, service usage, and demographic distributions.

## Project Structure

- **Telecom_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.

## Visualizations and Insights

1. **Customer Lifetime Value Distribution**
   - Insight: The majority of customers have a lower lifetime value, with a steep drop as the lifetime value increases. A few customers have very high lifetime values.
   - Conclusion: Efforts to increase customer retention and upsell services might significantly boost the overall customer lifetime value.

2. **Tenure in Months Distribution**
   - Insight: There is a relatively uniform distribution of customer tenure with a peak at the high end (around 70 months).
   - Conclusion: A substantial number of long-term customers might indicate good service satisfaction, but efforts should be made to convert shorter-tenured customers into long-term ones.

3. **Internet Type Distribution**
   - Insight: Fiber Optic is the most common internet type, followed by DSL and then Cable.
   - Conclusion: Emphasis on maintaining and expanding fiber optic services could be beneficial, given its popularity.

4. **Marital Status Distribution**
   - Insight: The distribution between married and non-married customers is nearly equal.
   - Conclusion: Marketing strategies should not heavily rely on marital status as a key differentiator.

5. **Monthly Charges Distribution**
   - Insight: Monthly charges have a diverse range with peaks around 20, 50, and 80, indicating varied customer segments.
   - Conclusion: Pricing strategies could be optimized to cater to different segments, ensuring that price-sensitive customers are not alienated.

6. **Age Distribution**
   - Insight: The age distribution of customers is quite varied, with a noticeable number of customers in their 20s and a steady count up to around 80 years old.
   - Conclusion: Services should be tailored to meet the needs of a wide age range, from tech-savvy young adults to older customers.

7. **Churn Distribution**
   - Insight: A significant portion of customers do not churn (label 0), while a smaller but notable portion does (label 1).
   - Conclusion: While the majority of customers are retained, churn prevention strategies should be implemented to reduce the number of customers leaving.

8. **Streaming TV Usage**
   - Insight: More customers do not use streaming TV compared to those who do.
   - Conclusion: There is potential for growth in the streaming TV market by creating more attractive streaming packages or partnerships.

9. **Streaming Movies Usage**
   - Insight: More customers do not use streaming movies compared to those who do.
   - Conclusion: Similar to streaming TV, there is an opportunity to increase streaming movie usage among customers.

10. **Streaming Music Usage**
    - Insight: A larger number of customers do not use streaming music services.
    - Conclusion: Offering bundled packages with streaming music or promotional offers could drive higher adoption.

11. **Gender Distribution**
    - Insight: The gender distribution is almost equal between males and females.
    - Conclusion: Marketing and service offerings should be gender-neutral and inclusive, as the customer base is evenly split.
